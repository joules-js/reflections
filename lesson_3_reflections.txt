When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When working with other people together.
    - When working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - if you are working on a project with several persons together, you first want to develop your features to the end before merging with the master

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - fork: copy a repository from github to your own github repository to use and change it to your own needs without wanting to push it on the original repository.
    - clone: copy a repository (e.g. from github to your own computer) to start develloping on it. You may want to push your changes to the original repository.
    - branch: save a version of your code for experiments or to develop features. You may want to push your changes to the master. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To work on the latest state, so not to many changes have to be merged.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    If you would work without GitHub, you could work with another version control like svn. Without any version control you will have to speak a lot with the persons you collaborate with. It would be a lot harder. 
    With Git or GitHub merging is easier. A lot of things work automatically!

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
